# Skyrim Alchemy Tool

A tool to help you master alchemy in Skyrim. (And help me learn webdev!)

## Credits

- Build with [astro-simple](https://github.com/lkhrs/astro-simple), a [Simple.css](https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css) theme for [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro).

- I found [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/rm1sg6/i_made_an_alchemyhelperapp/) when looking for a Skyrim Alchemy app. That led me to his [repo](https://github.com/Finbel/alchemy), which is where I found the json files. It then led me to create an iOS Shortcut called [Skyrim Alchemy Tool](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/19465/) which was a lot of fun to make.
